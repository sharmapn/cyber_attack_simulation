# cyber_attack_simulation
Cyber attack simulation shown on University Open Day


For our university Open Day, we created a demonstration for distributed denial of service using Python. 
There were two components:
- a script that mimics many machines sending the DDOS attacks to a server
- a server and a script on the server that tries to prevent these attacks
