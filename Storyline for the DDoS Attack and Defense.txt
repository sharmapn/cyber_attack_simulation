Storyline for the DDoS Attack and Defense Simulation
Welcome to our DDoS attack and defense simulation! Today, I'll walk you through what's happening in a cyber-attack scenario in real time.

1. Introduction to DDoS: We’re simulating a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack. In a DDoS, multiple machines flood a server with fake requests, overwhelming it so it can’t respond to legitimate users. Imagine hundreds of people trying to walk through a single door at the same time – no one gets through!

2. The Attack Begins:

On the screen, you see many machines attacking a target server. Each machine is sending a huge number of requests to try and take down the server. The colored lines connecting them show this traffic flow.
As more traffic hits the server, you’ll see the lines intensify, meaning the attack is getting stronger.
Our goal here is to overload the server and make it unresponsive.
3. Real-Time Server Monitoring:

On the right side, we have CPU, memory, and bandwidth usage graphs. These show how the attack impacts the server.
CPU Usage: The higher the graph, the more the server is struggling to handle all these requests.
Memory Usage: This shows how much memory the server is using to process the traffic.
Bandwidth Usage: This represents how much data the server is receiving.
4. Defense and IP Switching:

Eventually, the server identifies some of the machines as attackers and blocks them. You’ll see their lines turn red, indicating that they’ve been shut out.
But the attack isn’t over! The blocked machines quickly change their IP addresses and rejoin the attack, trying to bypass the defenses.
As students, your job would be to configure defenses that adjust and adapt faster than the attackers.
5. Progression of the Attack:

You’ll also notice the progress bar at the bottom, showing how the attack evolves. It starts slowly but quickly escalates until the server is overwhelmed.
The attack is dynamic – machines are blocked, recover, and new waves of traffic keep hitting the server.
6. Wrap-up:

This simulation gives you a hands-on understanding of how DDoS attacks work and how servers try to defend themselves.
Cybersecurity experts need to stay one step ahead of attackers, using tools and strategies to protect critical systems.
