can you help me create a demonstration for distributed denial of service using python? there are three components:
- a script that has mimics many machines sending the dos attacks to a server
- a server
- a script the tries to prevent these attacks on server

###

can you modify the attack script "DDoS Attack Simulation Script (Multiple Clients Sending Requests)"  to include a pyqt gui that shows the status of each attack machine
###

good, can you draw machine labels, which are intially green colored when they are runnimg and red when they are blocked?

###

after being blocked, can this script restart the attack with a different ip number

###

along the lines of what is have suggested and what you have sugegsted, can you suggest more ideas on how to improve the simulation (process and graphics or animation) so that it would appeal to students in our university open day next week

###
can you code all aspects you mentioned in "Improved Graphics and Animation:" and "Interactive Elements for Students:"

###

can you add the following:

Real-time Server Monitoring:
Display real-time server resource graphs (CPU, memory, bandwidth usage) to show how the server is affected by the attack. These graphs could be simple line charts that update every second, providing a more realistic view of what happens when a DDoS attack hits.
Tools: Use psutil to track resource usage and display it in a PyQt graph

####

can you add the following features:

- Create a network map showing the connections between attacking machines and the target server. Use lines or arrows representing traffic flows, which intensify (become thicker or change color) as the attack progresses.
- When a machine is blocked, animate the line turning red or fading out to indicate a loss of connection.
- Implement a progress bar or timeline showing the stages of the attack: initiation, traffic overload, blocking of machines, and IP switching. The students can see how the server gets overwhelmed and how the machines "recover" by changing IPs.
- You could make this more engaging with sound effects (e.g., a "beep" when a machine gets blocked or successfully reconnects).
- Server Monitoring: can you add resource monitoring using psutil to show CPU or memory usage on the server.

####

can you separate the window. the map on top should remain as it is, spanning the whole width. However, the panels below should be divided into left and right.

the left panel should show the attack options:
- number of machines slider
- speed of attack slider
- the progress bar
- and the panel containing the status of each attack machine

the right panel should show the server's 
- CPU, 
- memory and 
- network bandwidth

###

the height of the map on top is very small - it should be 1/3 of the window - which lines of code should I change

###


can you establish scenario-based Learning:
- where Instead of just showing machines attacking a server, we present it as a cyber defense scenario where the students need to defend a fictitious company's server against attackers. They can see how various attacks impact the server, and how different mitigation strategies work in real time.
- Integrate videos or voiceovers explaining whatâ€™s happening in the simulation. and so we can save the video or voiceover

###

can you get rid of the cpu, memory and network graphs on the right side,
and instead arrange so that 
- the network map on top is 1/3 of the height
- the rest (2/3) of the height is taken up by one panel which has left and right panels
- the left panel is dedicated to attack. It should include the progress bar of attack, the number of machines slider, the attack speed slider, and the machines' status 
- the right panel is dedicated to defense. It shoukd contain mechanisms for defence, like enable and disable defence, allowing users to block attacking machines based on requests made within, say 5 secongs

###

the panel on the right side contains 'enable defence', 'reset defence' and a box that shows all the blocked Machines.

But none of these work. can you ensure these work.
also add a feature on the right panel, where users can choose the request interval to block - that is, if X requests are made within 5 seconds,  block the machine

###

there is a textarea on the panel on the right called blocked machines.
it should also show the list of blocked machines. but currently nothing is being shown there.
can you ensue that the list of blocked machines are also shown there?

###

its still not working. can you just make it so that whatever is shown in Machine Status textarea in the left panel is also shown in the Blocked Machine textarea in the right panel.

###

the gui shows, but then crases and disappears

###

okay great. now can you separate the attack and defence into two scripts that could run on separate machines? both should show the network map, and the rest should be separated.

###

in the attack.py script, if i increase or decrease the 'number of machines' and 'attack speed', it should work, but its not working.

###

the defense.py script runs, shows the blocked machines but crashes after a few seconds.

###

in the defense.py script, the network map is great, but shoukl show the atatck machines as the attack is made, not 50 predefined 

###

i intend to have the attck.py and defense.py running on two separate machines. what kind of network should i deploy to connect these two machines - will a peer to peer would be enough or i have to connect the computers using router?

###

i am actually going to run the attack.py and defence.py on two separate machines. 
But I am sure it will work. could you make sure that all aspects of the code will work in that setup? also in the defense.py script, please ensure that the 'enable defense', 'reset defense' and request threshold slider are working. 
- the enable/(disable) defense should start or stop the defense 
- the reset defense should clear all information in the textarea for 'Blocked Machines'

###

I am now testing these two scripts on the two different machines that will be used for simulation tommorrow. However, the network map in the 'defense.py' just shows two nodes, the attacker machine and the defender (server) machine. Can this be changed to show all the different IP numbers that are generated in the attack.py script?

###

I ran the new version of the 'attack.py' script but the network map in defense.py still only shows tow machines.

###

it works. but in the defense.py, the list of blocked machines only shows the single 'physical' IP number. Can you change it so that it includes all the generated IP numbers. 

also in the defense.py, in the network map, can you ensure that once an IP is blocked, the corresponding node is removed from the network map?

###

I tried this defense.py script - but it still does not remove the blocked IP from the network Map. can you please ensure its working.

also, please add as much exception handling in the script so that it does not crash during demosntration.


###

can you modify the network diagram in the attack.py script to include different colored lines between the nodes and the attack machine as follows. 
- Green for reconnected, 
- orange for changing IP, and
- red for blocked. 

can you also do this for the network diagram in the defense.py as follows:
- the lines should initially be green but they turn red when it is determined that too many requests are made from the node. 

can you also add a progres bar in the defense.py script that shows the number of requests made against the machine per second (it should update every second). The progress bar should be gradient of green and red mixture. As the value in this progress bar gets higher, the bar turns more red


update the colors every second based on node status.

####

can you modify the defence.py script a little bit so that there is an alarm sound heard when the request load is more than 20 percent?
